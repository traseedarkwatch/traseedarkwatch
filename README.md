Hello there! üò∏

I am @traseedarkwatch, also known as Trasee Darkwatch, Trasee Darque, or just Trasee. I'm from California, mostly seen in Second Life or various other online communities. I've been working with code since BASIC on the Commodore-64 and have been online since the CompuServe days. üôÄ

My language experience:
- **ASP.NET:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Yes, I have experience here, but am so out of touch with it. I can read it and work with it, but it's changed a lot since I used it last.
- **C#:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê Mostly coding in .NET 6.0. This is my go-to and strongest coding experience.
- **HTML:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê I used to do web design starting with HTML 2.0 and stopped when XHTML 1.1 was still new. I still do some web work with HTML 5, but it really isn't a forte.
- **JavaScript:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê I've worked with JS since working with HTML, and have never gotten away from it. Haven't worked much with web/JavaScript frameworks.
- **LSL:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê The Second Life Linden Scripting Language. A bastard child that can barely be called a "language" let alone "scripting" but it is what Second Life uses, so I learned it.
- **PHP:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê I used to modify WordPress and PHPBB. I can still work with it, but I prefer to let others handle it where possible.
- **Python:** ‚≠ê I just started looking into this because of RenPy. Thought it might be fun to create visual novels, but haven't really delved into it too much.
- **VB.NET:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê Haven't worked with this in years, preferring C#, but this is where I started with ASP.NET 1.0.

More than just coding, I get into the artistic side as well:
- **Blender:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê I create 3D models for use in Second Life. Usually, I plan it out in Second Life first, export from there and bring into Blender to be fully designed and optimized.
- **Filter Forge:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê I don't create my own filters, but choose from the hundreds of existing filters and modify them to create my own textures to use in Second Life.
- **GIMP:** ‚≠ê‚≠ê This is my goto for image editing. I'm subscribed to Adobe's services for access to their suite of image editing tools, but GIMP is still preferred.

What are those stars, and what do they mean?
- ‚≠ê - Initiate. Just starting to look at this. Very superficial knowledge. Google is my friend.
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê - Novice. I know enough to get around and do what needs to get done. Much Google-Fu is still required.
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Experienced. The Force is strong in this one but some training still is required. Google is used to fill in gaps.
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Expert. I know a lot about this and can perform even more complex tasks. More innate knowledge, less Google.
- ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê - Master. I know it all and keep up with all the changes to continue to know it all. Google comes to me for the information. Of course, I have nothing in this category, nor do I see myself ever having anything in this category. I do strive for it, though.
